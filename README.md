🌍 TripAdvisor Clone Website
This is a simple TripAdvisor Clone website built using HTML and CSS. I created this project to practice building the layout of a real-world travel website and to improve my frontend development skills.

🔧 What I Used
HTML for the page structure

CSS for styling and layout

📄 Features
Header with logo and navigation menu

Hero section with background image and text

Sections for hotels, restaurants, and attractions (like the TripAdvisor homepage)

Footer with basic links and info

Basic responsive layout

This project is only for learning purposes and is not connected to the real TripAdvisor website. I'm still learning and will keep improving it as I grow!

Thank you for visiting!
